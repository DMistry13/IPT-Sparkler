# IPT-Sparkler
Made by Dhruv Mistry for the IPT 2022 Competition.

Scripts run on original videos - not uploaded. But the python script anddata generated is uploaded. The main.py runs through the scripts, long_exp.py, new_track.py, and post.py. The long_exp.py creates the videos and long-expsure like pictures. The new_track.py "spots" the sparkles at each frames, saves th central position, frame it occured and calculated velocity in a .csv file. 

Then post.py runs through all the .csv files and makes subsequent plots. All the videos are not uploaded as the compression time is long.
